## About Alfred

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) is an amazing app for your Mac that can perform most of your tedius, every-day tasks. In addition, Alfred is extensible and ever-improving, providing a great deal of utility and power to your Mac.

I highly recommend getting the [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/), as it provides so many awesome features and can even replace many applications you currently use.
